"""Shared python-interpreter trust gate for hook installers.

Every adapter persists an absolute interpreter path into a hook command that
fires under the host agent. A writable or foreign-owned interpreter (or one
sitting in a writable directory) is a persistence vector: whoever controls the
bytes controls every future hook invocation. This module is the single gate
all installers share; per-adapter copies were consolidated here so the
semantics cannot drift between adapters.

Pure stat, never runs the target.
