"""Token Optimizer — Grok Build installer.

Wires Token Optimizer into Grok Build's hooks system:

1. Copies the adapter modules into ``<grok_home>/token-optimizer/plugin/``
   so the hook bridge runs from a stable path that survives repo moves.
2. Writes OUR OWN hooks file ``$GROK_HOME/hooks/token-optimizer.json``
   (Grok scans ``~/.grok/hooks/*.json`` as a DIRECTORY of files — unlike
   Cursor's single shared hooks.json — so TO owns its file outright and never
   merges with, or clobbers, another tool's hooks).
3. Refuses on native Windows (``os.name == "nt"``): the persisted ``command``
   string is POSIX-shell quoted and cmd.exe would not parse it.

The hooks JSON format is Grok's documented shape (10-hooks.md "The Hook JSON
Format"): ``{"hooks": {<Event>: [{matcher?, hooks: [{type, command, timeout}]}]}}``.

Idempotent: re-running refreshes the payload and rewrites OUR file only.
Uninstall removes only OUR hooks file and the payload dir; session data stays.

Usage:
    python3 grok_install.py install [--dry-run]
    python3 grok_install.py uninstall [--dry-run]
