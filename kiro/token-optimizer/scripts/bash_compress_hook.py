"""Token Optimizer v5.12: PostToolUse Bash Compression Hook.

Compresses Bash tool output AFTER execution via Claude Code's
``updatedToolOutput`` mechanism. This is the UNIT B expansion: it handles
pipeline and metachar-containing commands that PreToolUse bash_hook.py
categorically rejects.

Architecture:
  CC runs Bash tool → PostToolUse fires → this hook receives tool_response
  → pipeline_analyzer checks read-only eligibility → bash_compress.compress()
  compresses stdout → archive raw original → attach archive pointer →
  enforce the baseline-size invariant → updatedToolOutput replaces what
  Claude sees.

The existing PreToolUse bash_hook.py continues to handle simple (metachar-free)
commands. This hook handles everything else — pipes, &&, ||, ;, redirections,
heredocs, and command substitutions.

Safety (same stack as bash_hook.py):
  - Fail-open: any exception → exit 0 with no output → Claude sees raw result
  - Read-only only: pipeline_analyzer rejects any side-effecting stage
  - No double-execution: command already ran; we only compress captured output
  - Token preservation: credential scan runs BEFORE compression
  - Raw output archived: the full stdout is stored with a retrievable key;
    the compressed output carries an expand pointer.
  - Baseline-size invariant: _enforce_baseline_invariant runs so the compressed
    preview never exceeds what Claude Code would show as baseline.
  - Error-on-stdout guard: _ERROR_STDERR_PATTERNS checked against stdout
    when stderr was redirected (2>&1), so compressed output never swallows
    error lines that appear on stdout.
  - Exit behavior: no output = pass through; JSON output = compress

Hook config (hooks/hooks.json):
  PostToolUse matcher "Bash" → bash_compress_hook.py --quiet
