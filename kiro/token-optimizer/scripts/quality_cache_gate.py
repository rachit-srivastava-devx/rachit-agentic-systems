"""Quality-cache throttle gate — lightweight pre-check before importing measure.py.

The PostToolUse ``quality-cache --throttle-only`` hook fires on EVERY tool call.
In the common case (throttle window active, ~97% of calls), it does nothing but
one stat() of a throttle marker file. But importing measure.py (44k+ lines, 2MB)
costs 682ms cold — paid on every single tool call before the throttle check
even runs. In a read-only-scripts container (the benchmark steady state),
__pycache__ never persists, so every call pays the cold import.

This gate mirrors the throttle-marker stat() that measure.py's
``_quality_cache_tick_due`` performs, but WITHOUT importing measure.py. If the
throttle window is still active (the common case), it exits 0 immediately.
Only when the throttle has EXPIRED does it fall through to import measure.py
and run the full quality-cache computation — exactly as today.

Mirrors the pattern every other hook script already uses to stay measure-free:
read_cache.py, bash_hook.py, bash_compress_hook.py, archive_result.py,
context_intel.py, refetch_guard.py all avoid importing measure.py deliberately.

HARD INVARIANT preserved: a throttle-only cache MISS (missing marker) never
parses a transcript. The gate treats a missing marker as "not due" (OSError →
False, mirroring ``_quality_cache_tick_due``) and exits 0 without importing
measure.py at all.
