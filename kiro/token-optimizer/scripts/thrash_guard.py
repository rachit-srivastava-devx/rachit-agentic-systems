"""Runtime thrash guard: nudge-only loop prevention across turns.

Why this exists
---------------
A per-command wrapper (e.g. JFrog Boost) is exec'd once per command and keeps
no cross-turn state, so it structurally cannot see an agent quietly re-running
the same command — the failure mode Boost's own blog describes ("an agent
quietly running `ls` six times to re-establish where it is ... So we needed the
agent itself to tell us. In band.") and a Boost blog post describing an agent
looping "until the user interrupts", caused by Boost and undetected). Token Optimizer
is a session-stateful hook, so it can see the streak and say something.

Design (nudge-only):
- Fire only on >= 3 consecutive runs of the SAME command with BYTE-IDENTICAL
  output. Any material output change resets the streak to 1, so a command
  whose output is evolving (progress bars, growing logs) never fires.
- Burn nudge: a second signal that fires when the SAME command
  (normalised: heredoc bodies stripped, so ``cat <<EOF > file`` edits with
  changing bodies count as one command) FAILS >= 3 times in a session with
  DIFFERENT output each time. This catches the edit-compile-fail cycle where
  the agent keeps re-running a command that fails differently each time —
  the exact pattern the identical-output guard cannot see.
- Inline-script repeat nudge: a third signal that fires when a command whose
  heredoc body is >= INLINE_SCRIPT_MIN_CHARS has been run >=
  INLINE_SCRIPT_THRESHOLD times this session under the same normalised hash
  (any outcome). The agent re-sends the whole inline script as input tokens
  every turn; saving it to a file and running the file avoids that cost.
- Never deny a tool call: the caller appends the nudge line to the output the
  agent already has. The command has already run; nothing is blocked.
- Cooldown: after a nudge at streak S, the next nudge waits until streak
  S + REPEAT_AFTER, so a long stuck loop is reminded periodically, not
  every turn.
- Staleness: a streak older than STALE_SECONDS is reset — repeats spaced
  hours apart are deliberate re-checks, not thrash.
- Fail-open everywhere: any error returns None and the output stands.
- Priority: identical-output nudge > burn nudge > inline-script nudge.
  Exactly one nudge per output.

The state lives in the per-session SessionStore (command_run_streaks), so
streaks never leak across sessions.
